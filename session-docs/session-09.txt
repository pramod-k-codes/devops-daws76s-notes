How to install application in Linux
-----------------------------------
We should have server

nodejs, .net, java, python, php, go, etc.

install that programming langugage

creating a directory

creating a seperate user for that application

downloading the application

install dependencies
nodejs --> npm
java --> mvn
python --> pip
.net --> nuget

we are giving how to run in /etc/systemd/system/application.service

systemctl start application
systemctl enable application

nodejs --> npm
maven --> automatically maven will install java
npm install = mvn clean package = it will give a jar file

java --> compile --> bytecode(.jar file)
python=nodejs = no need of compile = no bytecode
