I have a detailed transcript from youTube related to python, and I need you to transform it into format notes with coding to read and learn. Here are the steps to follow:

Summarize the content into topics and subtopics, converting the information into a easy reviewable format

Focus on the main points and elaborate where necessary to ensure a comprehensive understanding of each topic along with including coding examples .

Remove any promotional content such as sponsors, social media mentions, or book promotions. Keep the author or speaker's introduction brief. you can add timestamp before each topic for future review along with url.

At the end  create a of the Q&A notes (this is should be 2nd from last section)
List out the main topics and subtopics to provide an overview of the content for easy skimming (This should be above last section).

Lastly, include a Key Topics for Revision section, highlighting the most important points to review before exams or revision sessions (this is the final section).

The final structure should look like this:

Topic 1: 
brief explanation and real time industry examples
sub topic: 
more detailed explanation with examples from real time
questions to quiz the topic 1

Topic 2:
brief explanation and real time industry examples
sub topic: 
more detailed explanation with examples from real time
questions to quiz the topic 2

Questions:
Questions from all the topics and subtopics with short answers 

Topics and Subtopics for Skimming

Key Topics and points for Revision
add simple appropriate coding examples with code when needed
