#### [06:42] Topic 4: Day 4 - Functions, Modules, and Packages  
- **Overview**: Understanding functions, modules, and packages at a basic level.
- **Subtopic 1**: Functions  
    - **Explanation**: Functions help in modular programming.
    - **Example**: Writing a simple function to demonstrate reusability.
  
- **Subtopic 2**: Virtual Environments  
    - **Explanation**: Introduction to Python virtual environments, an essential concept for DevOps projects.
    - **Example**: How to set up and use virtual environments in Python.

```python
# Simple Python function:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("DevOps Engineer"))
```

- **Quiz**:

- **Overview**: Importance of environment variables and how to use command-line arguments in Python.
- **Subtopic 1**: Environment Variables  
    - **Explanation**: How to read and write environment variables in Python.
    - **Example**: Setting and retrieving environment variables.

```python
import os
# Get the value of an environment variable
db_user = os.getenv('DB_USER')
print(db_user)
```

- **Quiz**:
  - How are environment variables used in Python?
  - What is the difference between an environment variable and a command-line argument?

- **Overview**: Learning conditional statements in Python such as `if`, `else`, and `elif`.
- **Subtopic 1**: Conditional Operators  
    - **Explanation**: Using conditions and their importance in automating scripts for DevOps tasks.
    - **Example**: Basic `if-else` conditions.

```python
# If-else example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
