### **1. Python Data Types**

**Brief Explanation**:  
Python supports several data types used to define the nature of the data stored in variables. These include strings, numeric types (integers, floats), sequences (lists, tuples), mappings (dictionaries), Booleans, and sets.

#### **1-1. Data Types Overview**  
- **String**: Used to store text, written in single or double quotes.  
- **Numeric**: Stores numbers, divided into integers and floats.  
- **Sequence**: Lists and tuples allow storage of multiple items in a single variable.  
- **Mapping**: A dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs.  
- **Boolean**: Stores `True` or `False`.  
- **Set**: Unordered collections of unique items.

**Real-Time Example**:  
In DevOps, you may work with AWS ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) as strings to extract specific information like usernames.

```python
# Example of splitting an ARN to get the username
arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe"
username = arn.split("/")[-1]
print(username)  # Output: JohnDoe
```

#### **1-2. Dynamically Typed Language**  
Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to declare the type of a variable explicitly. It’s inferred based on the syntax.

```python
x = 5         # integer
y = "hello"   # string
z = 3.14      # float
```

**Quiz**:  
1. What are Python’s primary data types?  
2. What does dynamically typed language mean?

### **2. String Handling in Python**

**Brief Explanation**:  
Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. Python offers many built-in functions for manipulating strings.

#### **2-1. String Functions**  
- **`split()`**: Splits a string into a list.  
- **`upper()`**: Converts all characters to uppercase.  
- **`len()`**: Returns the length of the string.

**Real-Time Example**:  
String manipulation can be useful in automating tasks like extracting information from logs.

```python
name = "Abhishek Veeramalla"
first_name = name.split()[0]
print(first_name)  # Output: Abhishek
```

#### **2-2. String Concatenation**  
Joining multiple strings together using the `+` operator.

```python
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
print(string1 + " " + string2)  # Output: Hello World
```

**Quiz**:  
1. How do you convert a string to uppercase in Python?  
2. What is string concatenation?

---

### **3. Numeric Data Types (Integers and Floats)**

**Brief Explanation**:  
Python has two primary numeric data types: integers and floats. Integers are whole numbers, while floats include decimal points.

#### **3-1. Integer and Float Functions**  
- **`round()`**: Rounds a float to a specific number of decimal places.  
- **`abs()`**: Returns the absolute value of a number.

**Real-Time Example**:  
Rounding numbers is useful when you deal with large sets of data that require concise representation.

```python
value = 3.14159
print(round(value, 2))  # Output: 3.14
```

**Quiz**:  
1. What does the `abs()` function do?  
2. How do you round a number to two decimal places?

---

### **4. Regular Expressions in Python**

**Brief Explanation**:  
Regular expressions (regex) allow pattern matching and manipulation in strings. Useful for searching, replacing, or extracting data based on patterns.

#### **4-1. Basic Regex Operations**  
- **`re.match()`**: Matches a pattern at the beginning of a string.  
- **`re.search()`**: Searches for the first location where the pattern matches.

**Real-Time Example**:  
DevOps engineers use regex to search for specific patterns in log files, such as finding all error logs.

```python
import re
pattern = r"error"
log = "error at line 42"
if re.search(pattern, log):
    print("Error found!")  # Output: Error found!
```

**Quiz**:  
1. What is the purpose of regular expressions?  
2. How can you search for a pattern in a string using regex in Python?

---

### **Questions**

1. What are the key data types in Python?  
   **Answer**: String, numeric, sequence, mapping, boolean, and set.
   
2. How do you declare a string in Python?  
   **Answer**: Use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `split()` function?  
   **Answer**: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.
