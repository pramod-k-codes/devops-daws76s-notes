(00:01) hello everyone my name is abishek and welcome back to my Channel today is day Zero of python for devops playlist and in this video we will learn about the course syllabus as well as the launch date now if you interested in learning python for devops through our Channel this is a mustat video because you need to understand what is the syllabus and when you are going to Learn Python for devops through this channel so the first thing that I want to explain before I deep dive into the course syllabus is that are there any prerequisites for
(00:38) this series so I want to explain this one because many of you might have this question yes there is one prerequisite that is everybody has to go through the course syllabus that's it that's the only prerequisite and the course syllabus is available in the GitHub repository so if you people have watched my previous playlist that can be terraform or AWS I maintain a GitHub repository and I create day wise folders and in this day wise folders if there are any materials that I want to share with you interview
(01:11) questions or any kind of notes I share through this day wise folders for example in day 10 I want to share something important so that you can practice what I have taught in the video that will be available in the day 10 folder similarly for all the 19 days there will be 19 different folders so please you can start this uh GitHub repository folk this GitHub repository or watch it whatever you would like to so that you will get the updates whenever I create some files in it now this is the first thing that I wanted to
(01:42) explain that is everyone has to go through the course syllabus before you start with day one so that you understand what exactly you are learning and what are you going to learn tomorrow right you have a proper road map of what you are going to learn now let's start with the course syllabus right so initially I promise to complete this in 15 days but when I writing the syllabus you know I take a lot of time in writing the syllabus so the one that you see here whatever is available in the read me document you
(02:12) know you might take some two to three minutes to read it but usually to prepare the syllabus I take two to three days because it is very important for me to structurize what I'm going to teach and while I was thinking about it you know instead of 15 days it was taking me some 20 days so finally I you know uh prepared the syllabus I prepared a draft then I reviewed it then finally it came up to 19 days so it is going to be 19 days and what you are going to learn on a day-to-day basis let me explain that so on day one that is the first day I
(02:48) will introduce you to python what does introduction mean so I will explain a bit of history of python right python 2 Python 3 and then we will move towards the installation of python so how to install python on Windows Mac Linux and GitHub Cod spaces because last time when we did the terraform Zero to Hero Series code spaces was very very useful right and many people don't have their personal laptops or many people don't have that much uh resources to run uh programs on their laptops so you can use the GitHub code spaces right so I'm
(03:25) also going to explain how to install and run your python programs on the GitHub codespace along with Windows Linux as well as Mac OS and then we will run about we'll learn about some basic configuration and we will conclude this session by installing a IDE if it is Mac OS or Linux or Windows I'll just show on one platform how how to install Ida that is going to be Visual Studio code or you can also use pyam these are the very popular ones one is pyam and the other is Visual Studio code so we'll learn
(03:58) either of one how to install and how to configure Visual Studio code for your python projects and finally we will write a very simple Python program so on day one the Python program is not going to be super big it's going to be a very very basic one because the intention here is to make sure that your python is installed and configured properly it will be as simple as a hollow World program or something and day two we will start learning about strings and numbers that is we are going to learn about string
(04:28) data types data types float data types all of these things now why I start with strings and numbers is very very it is very very easy to understand strings and numbers first so we will perform some string manipulations we will perform some string formatting usually in interviews there will be many questions related to string formatting if a devops engineer is giving interview on python or let's say they want to ask you some program they want they want you to write some program so you know most of the times there will be some string
(05:01) manipulations and operations that are asked so we will learn about that string manipulations on day two it will be very basic because you will not be I mean on day two you will not have experience on Loops or if conditions so that's why we will learn about string manipulations and formatting but a very basic ones then we will learn about regular expressions and finally we will also learn about integer float and perform some operations on them then we will learn about variables variables are key for any programming language because using
(05:38) variables you can make your program Dynamic right it can be any programming language by using variables you can Dynamic uh you know you can make your uh program Dynamic and python is a dynamic uh dynamically typed if you talk about other programming languages like goang it's a statically type programming language but python is a dynamically typed programming language and variables play a very critical role here so that's why we will learn about variable we will write a program and we will use variables in it then we will learn about
(06:12) the scope of the variables what is local scope what is Lifetime you know Global we will learn about all of these things we will learn about some good practices how to write variables the naming Convention of the variables because when during an interview if you're writing a program right interviewers will look for this how are you declaring a variable what is the naming convention that you are providing what are the best practices are you following them or not right we will learn about all of these things then on day four we will move
(06:42) towards understanding functions modules and packages now don't worry here on the day four because you just learn about strings and numbers and variables I will not deep dive so much into functions modules and packages because later days you will learn very much about them but the reason why I want to make you learn about functions modules and packages on a basic level is because you know uh going ahead when you want to learn operators or when you want to learn or when you want to perform some basic operations you will import a
(07:17) lot of packages it can be OS package CIS package so when I want you to explain about import statements and packages before you understanding what exactly is a package it will be very difficult so that's why I will teach you on a basic level what is a function what is a module what is a package what are the difference between them and then we will learn how to import a package and there is a very very important concept called python workspaces or virtual environments whatever you would like to call right python virtual environments
(07:49) is a very important concept we will learn on day four then comes day five in day five we will learn about envirment variables as well as command line arguments again environment variables and command line arguments are very very powerful Concepts and we use these things a lot because usually as a devops engineer when you write programs you know you take inputs and inputs can be through command line arguments are envirment variables so it is very important for you to understand how to read envirment variable how to write to an envirment
(08:25) variable how to use command line arguments when there are multiple command line arguments how to to read them so all of these things is required so that is your Dy then comes python operators operators keywords these are the pillars for any programming language so till day five we did not you know uh we did not learn any advanced concept but after day five you know we want to learn some advanced concepts so to start with advanced concepts firstly you need to know about the operators so in any programming language there are operators
(09:00) specific to python you have arithmetic operators you have logical operators bitwise operators assignment operators so sorry so what are all these what are all of these operators so we will learn each and every operator in detail I will also provide you a very detailed notes and assignment is also available and mostly what I'm planning in this particular series is to give you assignments so that you can evaluate your understand stand so I will also try to give some assignments on this and specifically in The Operators we will do
(09:36) practicals as well as I'll give you some assignments and here we will perform a project uh with operators You Can Do Magic you can do uh you know it will be very very tricky if you don't understand it uh uh you know in a very uh good manner right when there are different operators for example bitwise operator or logical operator probably bitwise operator you don't use as much as developers use as devops Engineers but let's say logical operator or arithmetic operator if you don't understand the
(10:05) functionality of it then you will find it difficult then comes some advanced concepts from day seven we will learn step by-step Advanced concept the first thing we will start with is the conditional handling so in conditional handling we will learn about if condition else if else all of these conditions and we will also perform some examples then we will start with the data types so I could have started data types even before this but the reason why I push data types to day8 is because I want you to learn in the proper
(10:41) structure most of the times you know if you look at any other python uh related courses data types is taught first but I did not want to teach data types first because you know these are all the fundamentals that you need to learn even before learning the data types right because let's say I will teach you about list and during the explanation of list if I want to explain some conditions on the list right or if I want to explain you about some Loop operations on the list then you will go blank you will say
(11:14) that but abishek you did not teach me anything about conditions or you did not teach me anything about loops now how will I understand list so I mean how will I understand operations on list I'll tell you iterate through the list so if I am not teaching you the loops it is very difficult to make you understand iteration on the list so that's why I split the list topics into two parts one is here and part two is on day 10 and between part one and part two I'll teach you about the loops so that I can
(11:43) explain you Loops I can explain you loops on the list operations so that you will learn with the Practical approach and every example that I take in this uh series I'll try to make devops I mean I'll try to make use of devop devops examples so that you understand this in a better way right I can take some practical examples real world examples other than devops but I will try as much as possible related to devops so that you can understand okay devops Engineers use Loops because they want to perform
(12:15) some operations related to devop stas right so going back firstly on day seven I'll teach you if conditions or conditional handling then on day eight you will learn basics of list and we will also try to use some conditioning on the list uh and we will also perform some you know how to retrieve uh a particular element on the list all those things and then we will learn about loops so here I'll make use of list concept because I have already taught you about list so when I explain about the loops I'll make use of this
(12:47) particular concept and I'll teach you list I'll teach you about the break statements continue which are nothing but the loop control statements and again we will do some example here this is uh the list part two where we will learn about list comprehensions some Advanced operations on the list interview questions what kind of interview questions can you expect on list nested list all of these things we will try to cover on Dat 10 then we will move towards another data type that is dictionaries and sets
(13:18) so basically when you are learning any programming language something that you have to focus is keywords operators data types because using these things you can write code without these things it is impossible to write the code and usually if you look at any program right it can be thousand lines 10,000 lines but these are the things that keep repeating keywords your uh you know data types variables or uh what was the other thing that I was talking about okay so in general uh I just forgot but you will use all of these
(13:52) things such as keywords your variables environment variables you will use uh data types all of these things are pillars to to programming language so that's why we'll focus more on that and then we will learn about functions and modules so how to write a function how to write a module what is the difference between function and module like I told you here I'll teach you a very basic one uh here on day four you will learn very Basics about functions and modules but here we will Deep dive so there are two
(14:20) uh sessions on this because to write a better program you need to use functions and modules that's why I'm taking two classes and we will also learn this from the devops engineer point of view where uh you know how does a devops engineer use functions how does a devops engineer use modules we will learn from that point of view and then uh moving on you will also learn about uh Lambda functions so this Lambda functions is not the Lambda functions related to AWS but in Python there is something called as Anonymous
(14:53) functions so we will learn uh in that point of view and then you will also learn about recursions all of some uh things that can be asked in the interviews then we'll focus two days on python libraries for devops because in Python there are hundreds of libraries hundreds of modules right but devops Engineers don't use all of them like devops Engineers very rarely use Paras right devops Engineers very rarely use numai or they don't even use but what are the common python libraries modules functions that are used by devop sers so
(15:26) we will learn about paramiko we will learn about fabric boto 3 right SSH connections and sorry again and here on day 15 we will learn little advance and we'll also write some programs day 16 how does devops engineers use Python to interact with the rest apis so we will learn that so on boto 3 in this particular class also when you are using boto 3 you will interact with the AWS apis but here we will learn how to interact with the apis directly that is you know uh using the request module how you can talk to an
(16:01) API or once you retrieve the information how you perform uh operations on it how do you convert Json to a dictionary how do you read a dictionary how do you handle errors all of these things you'll try to learn in day 16 day 17 we will learn about data serialization and configuration files so this is somewhere related where we will focus more on Json and yaml and we will try to learn about the serialization of data day 18 we will learn about cron jobs because as a devops engineer you write a lot of cron jobs so we will
(16:34) learn about automation with Cron job and finally day 19 will be python interview questions and answers right so this is how I have structured the entire python series like I told you it will be 19 days and there are 19 folders here there is only one prerequisite that is you need to go through this core syllabus thoroughly you know there is one advantage if you go through the core syab thoroughly that is you will know beforehand what abishek is going to teach tomorrow you will know that okay in this 19 days this is what I'm going
(17:06) to learn right if possible I'll elaborate this uh core syllabus even more and uh you know I'll keep updating this folders not sometimes I update it after the video but sometimes I update it before also whenever I have some time I try to run some practicals I write to run some demos before I make the video so you know if I find something good and interesting I'll upload in the day wise folders as well so you can start and folk this folder as you like so this is about the entire uh python Series so
(17:39) like I told you again 19 days and the course starts from 20th of this month right today is 13th and the course starts from 20th so it is important for you to understand that you know day wise you will learn some important concept from the devops engineering point of view you might be thinking there are so many courses on python how this is different this is different because I'll teach you from the devops point of view I'll not be covering all the concepts but I'll be covering the concepts that are used by devops Engineers mostly and
(18:16) how to answer during the interviews when in interview if they give you a program how to handle that all of these things we will try to learn in this series so I think I've covered all the information one final thing that I want to tell you is if you have any questions you can either post them detailed on the YouTube comment or there is also a specific private telegram Channel you will get access to it by clicking on the join button by becoming a member of the channel and while practicing these things if you have any questions there
(18:47) are more than 200 people on that membership Channel you can interact with them you can talk with them and if there are any things that people cannot solve within I will try to pitch in and I'll also try to explain so this is a video I hope you found it interesting stay tuned for day uh sorry stay tuned for 20th of this month when I start this series right thank you so much take care everyone bye-bye
